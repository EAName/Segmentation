# SAM 2 Few-Shot/Zero-Shot Segmentation: Domain Adaptation with Minimal Supervision

## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive study on combining Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) with few-shot and zero-shot learning techniques for domain-specific segmentation tasks. We investigate how minimal supervision can adapt SAM 2 to new object categories across three distinct domains: satellite imagery, fashion, and robotics. Our approach combines SAM 2's powerful segmentation capabilities with CLIP's text-image understanding and advanced prompt engineering strategies. We demonstrate that with as few as 1-5 labeled examples, our method achieves competitive performance on domain-specific segmentation tasks, while zero-shot approaches using enhanced text prompting show promising results for unseen object categories.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Semantic segmentation is a fundamental computer vision task with applications across numerous domains. Traditional approaches require extensive labeled datasets for each new domain or object category, making them impractical for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. Recent advances in foundation models, particularly SAM 2 and CLIP, have opened new possibilities for few-shot and zero-shot learning in segmentation tasks.

### 1.2 Motivation

The combination of SAM 2's segmentation capabilities with few-shot/zero-shot learning techniques addresses several key challenges:

1. **Domain Adaptation**: Adapting to new domains with minimal labeled examples
2. **Scalability**: Reducing annotation requirements for new object categories
3. **Generalization**: Leveraging pre-trained knowledge for unseen classes
4. **Practical Deployment**: Enabling rapid deployment in new environments

### 1.3 Contributions

This work makes the following contributions:

1. **Novel Architecture**: A unified framework combining SAM 2 with CLIP for few-shot and zero-shot segmentation
2. **Domain-Specific Prompting**: Advanced prompt engineering strategies tailored for satellite, fashion, and robotics domains
3. **Attention-Based Prompt Generation**: Leveraging CLIP's attention mechanisms for improved prompt localization
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Extensive experiments across multiple domains with detailed performance analysis
5. **Open-Source Implementation**: Complete codebase for reproducibility and further research

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Segment Anything Model (SAM)

SAM introduced a paradigm shift in segmentation by enabling zero-shot segmentation through various prompt types (points, boxes, masks, text). SAM 2 builds upon this foundation with improved architecture and performance.

### 2.2 Few-Shot Learning

Few-shot learning has been extensively studied in computer vision, with approaches ranging from meta-learning to metric learning. Recent work has focused on adapting foundation models for few-shot scenarios.

### 2.3 Zero-Shot Learning

Zero-shot learning leverages semantic relationships and pre-trained knowledge to recognize unseen classes. CLIP's text-image understanding capabilities have enabled new approaches to zero-shot segmentation.

### 2.4 Domain Adaptation

Domain adaptation techniques aim to transfer knowledge from source to target domains. Our work focuses on adapting segmentation models to new domains with minimal supervision.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

Given a target domain D and a set of object classes C, we aim to:
- **Few-shot**: Learn to segment objects in C using K labeled examples per class (K << 100)
- **Zero-shot**: Segment objects in C without any labeled examples, using only text descriptions

### 3.2 Architecture Overview

Our approach combines three key components:

1. **SAM 2**: Provides the core segmentation capabilities
2. **CLIP**: Enables text-image understanding and similarity computation
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Generates effective prompts for SAM 2 based on text and visual similarity

### 3.3 Few-Shot Learning Framework

#### 3.3.1 Memory Bank Construction

We maintain a memory bank of few-shot examples for each class:

```
M[c] = {(I_i, m_i, f_i) | i = 1...K}
```

Where I_i is the image, m_i is the mask, and f_i is the CLIP feature representation.

#### 3.3.2 Similarity-Based Prompt Generation

For a query image Q, we compute similarity with stored examples:

```
s_i = sim(f_Q, f_i)
```

High-similarity examples are used to generate SAM 2 prompts.

#### 3.3.3 Training Strategy

We employ episodic training where each episode consists of:
- Support set: K examples per class
- Query set: Unseen examples for evaluation

### 3.4 Zero-Shot Learning Framework

#### 3.4.1 Enhanced Prompt Engineering

We develop domain-specific prompt templates:

**Satellite Domain:**
- "satellite view of buildings"
- "aerial photograph of roads"
- "overhead view of vegetation"

**Fashion Domain:**
- "fashion photography of shirts"
- "clothing item top"
- "apparel garment"

**Robotics Domain:**
- "robotics environment with robot"
- "industrial equipment"
- "safety equipment"

#### 3.4.2 Attention-Based Prompt Localization

We leverage CLIP's cross-attention mechanisms to localize relevant image regions:

```
A = CrossAttention(I, T)
```

Where A represents attention maps indicating regions relevant to text prompt T.

#### 3.4.3 Multi-Strategy Prompting

We employ multiple prompting strategies:
1. **Basic**: Simple class names
2. **Descriptive**: Enhanced descriptions
3. **Contextual**: Domain-aware prompts
4. **Detailed**: Comprehensive descriptions
